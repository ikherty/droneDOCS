Previously (before 2020-2021), most users flew with analog systems operating at 5.8GHz, and for record distances, some used the 1.2GHz (also known as 1.3GHz) frequency. Since 2019, digital video systems such as <a href="https://oscarliang.com/dji-digital-fpv-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DJI FPV</a> and <a href="https://oscarliang.com/fatshark-byte-frost-hd-fpv-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FatShark Byte Frost</a> have appeared on the market. Byte Frost later transformed into <a href="https://oscarliang.com/fatshark-shark-byte/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FatShark SharkByte</a>, but it struggled to compete due to poorer signal quality and image compared to DJI FPV. FatShark abandoned the project, and it was reworked by Divimath into <a href="https://oscarliang.com/hdzero-digital-fpv-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HDZero</a>. In 2022, the <a href="https://oscarliang.com/setup-avatar-fpv-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Walksnail Avatar, also known as FatShark Dominator HD</a>, entered the market, followed by the <a href="https://oscarliang.com/dji-o3-air-unit-fpv-goggles-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">new generation DJI FPV Goggles 2 (G2), Integra, and O3 unit</a> at the end of 2022 and early 2023.</p><h3 id="is-walksnail-avatar-the-same-as-fatshark-dominator-hd" tabindex="-1">Is Walksnail Avatar the same as FatShark Dominator HD? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-walksnail-avatar-the-same-as-fatshark-dominator-hd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Walksnail Avatar the same as FatShark Dominator HD?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The situation with Walksnail is interesting (or not): for the DJI FPV system, the onboard part (the receiving and transmitting modules with cameras and antennas, known as <a href="https://caddxfpv.com/products/nebula-pro-vista-kit-720p-120fps-low-latency-hd-digital-fpv-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vista</a> + Nebula/Polar camera) was also developed by <a href="https://caddxfpv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Caddx</a>, a company that originally specialized in analog and action cameras. When FatShark Dominator HD was being developed, Caddx also created their version of these goggles (the same, but gray) and the onboard part, releasing them not under their name, but under the name Walksnail, even creating a separate website for it. However, it soon became clear what was happening, and DJI ceased collaboration with Caddx, prohibiting them from producing the onboard part for DJI FPV. Many at that time feared that Vista would no longer be available, but this niche was taken over by <a href="https://www.runcam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RunCam</a>, which was already engaged in analog video systems, action cameras, and had been producing cameras for predecessors of HDZero and DJI FPV (Phoenix HD, MIPI), leading to the creation of the <a href="https://shop.runcam.com/search.php?search_query=link&amp;Search=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RunCam Link</a>. Caddx stopped hiding that they are Walksnail and moved all products and documentation for the Avatar system to their website.</p><h3 id="why-did-fatshark-dominator-hd-appear-if-previous-attempts-by-fatshark-to-create-a-digital-link-were-unsuccessful" tabindex="-1">Why did FatShark Dominator HD appear if previous attempts by FatShark to create a Digital Link were unsuccessful? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-did-fatshark-dominator-hd-appear-if-previous-attempts-by-fatshark-to-create-a-digital-link-were-unsuccessful" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why did FatShark Dominator HD appear if previous attempts by FatShark to create a Digital Link were unsuccessful?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You can find <a href="https://youtu.be/u8ThI-cR_3Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a full explanation here</a>. There was news that Redcat Holdings acquired FatShark. At that time, Redcat Holdings had already bought companies related to drones, such as Rotor Riot, DroneBox (and others), and simultaneously collaborated with DJI. Can you guess what happened? A great marketing move. Not only would it become easier to advertise and promote FatShark&#39;s products, but there is also a somewhat substantiated opinion that Avatar was created in the likeness of the first generation DJI FPV. Currently, the Avatar video system is indeed quite popular; Walksnail continues to develop new onboard systems for it, and in some ways, Avatar already surpasses DJI FPV, but whether it will become the leader in digital video systems remains a question.</p><h3 id="what-happened-to-analog-system-now" tabindex="-1">What happened to Analog system now? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened-to-analog-system-now" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What happened to Analog system now?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>People are gradually forgetting about analog systems, and more beginners are starting their FPV journey with digital systems. When the only worthy digital option was DJI FPV, there were no solutions for micro drones (tiny whoops) that used 1S batteries (while digital onboard parts, which we will simply call units, required at least 8V). Additionally, using them in races was challenging for several reasons: significant latency (compared to analog), difficulties in outputting and tracking for judges and organizers, and occasional communication issues with 4+ pilots in the same flight, not to mention the higher costs (racing drones are 100% consumables; any part can break, shatter, or burn).</p><p>Now, however, HDZero and Avatar offer solutions for micro drones, with whoop/light units able to run on 3.1 to 5V, and the weight increase compared to DJI units is not significant, even if you lighten them by removing the casing. In terms of latency, HDZero and Avatar (in race mode) are not far from analog, while the image quality is still more pleasant. However, digital solutions are still more expensive than analog (unless comparing with the high-end segment, which is not much cheaper than digital), and many cannot afford digital solutions when starting on a budget. Thus, analog remains relevant, but it is already clear that almost nothing new is being produced for analog, and newcomers who start with analog in the hobby eventually transition to digital.</p><h3 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Currently, there are the following options that are only compatible within their own categories (meaning both the receiver and transmitter must be one of the options listed below):</p><ul><li>DJI FPV</li><li>Walksnail Avatar, also known as FatShark Dominator HD</li><li>HDZero</li><li>Analog</li></ul><p>Which option to choose is up to you; study all the nuances of each system and decide what best suits your style.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of the current video systems as of 2023 can be found <a href="https://oscarliang.com/fpv-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. <a href="https://oscarliang.com/js/fpvgogglefov.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Here</a> you can compare the FOV (field of view) of different goggles.</p><h2 id="integra-or-dji-goggles-2-g2" tabindex="-1">Integra or DJI Goggles 2 (G2)? <a class="header-anchor" href="#integra-or-dji-goggles-2-g2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Integra or DJI Goggles 2 (G2)?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Differences between Integra and Goggles 2:</p><ol><li>The touch panel on G2 has been replaced with a button and joystick like on FPV Goggles V1 and V2.</li><li>The LED screen indicating the transmission channel has been removed.</li><li>The antennas are non-removable.</li><li>The FOV has decreased from 51 to 44 degrees.</li><li>The focal length adjustment has been removed, but a set of 11 pairs of diopter lenses from -8 to +2 in 1 diopter increments is included.</li><li>The mask design has been slightly altered.</li><li>The battery is located at the back of the head, and the cable is integrated into the strap.</li><li>WiFi and Bluetooth have been removed.</li><li>GPS has been added.</li><li>The power button is on the goggles&#39; body.</li><li>There is an SD card slot between the eyes.</li><li>The goggles have a head strap similar to FPV Goggles.</li><li>There is no light sensor.</li><li>The headphone jack and speakers have been removed.</li></ol><h2 id="analog" tabindex="-1">Analog <a class="header-anchor" href="#analog" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Analog&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="what-types-of-video-reception-devices-are-there" tabindex="-1">What Types of Video Reception Devices Are There? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-types-of-video-reception-devices-are-there" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What Types of Video Reception Devices Are There?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>These can include:</p><ul><li>FPV goggles</li><li>FPV helmet</li><li>Monitor with a built-in/connected receiver</li><li>Video receiver for connecting to a phone via OTG</li></ul><p>Analog helmets and goggles can come with either a single receiver or dual (diversity).
